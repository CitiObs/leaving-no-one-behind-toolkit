## How to Navigate this Toolkit

This toolkit has been designed to make it easy for the reader to move about freely, and jump to any particular section as needed.  However, we have attempted to organise it along a logical sequence (inspired by the [NESTA Open Book of Social Innovation](https://www.nesta.org.uk/report/the-open-book-of-social-innovation/)) that roughly represents the life-cycle of a project or an initiative:&#x20;

1. REFLECTION - turn to this section to read about the 'Leave No One Behind' pledge and reflect the concepts of justice, equity, diversity and inclusion
2. DIALOGUE - this section
3. INSIGHT GATHERING - this section
4. PLANNING - this section
5. OUTREACH & ENGAGEMENT - this section
6. CO-CREATION & CO-PRODUCTION - this section
7. EVALUATION - this section

### Section Structure

The title page of each section introduces the topic with a description of its contents, followed by question-led sub-pages that:

* describe why that question is relevant, and
* how to get started,&#x20;
* list useful resources
* provide example case studies (when available),
* provide links to other relevant sections of the CitiObs Toolkits, and
* provide a list of references

Over time we will continue to add resources and case study examples, and welcome any contributions that you might have, or suggestions of what might be missing. Just [drop us a note in this form](https://citiobs.eu/contact/), and we'd be be thrilled to add your suggestions to the toolkit!
