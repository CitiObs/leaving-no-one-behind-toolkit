## How to Navigate this Toolkit

Readers can use this toolkit freely by navigating through each section, without any particular predefined order. However, even if readers can jump into different sections as needed, the toolkit follows a logical sequence that progressively builds upon tools that can help navigate a generic community-led action co-creation process.

In each section, when possible, links to existing resources are provided. The overall toolkit is also meant to be iterative, and it provides reflection tools that can help better define future steps and reflect on the results achieved.

Conceptually, this toolkit is divided into the following parts:

1. **Welcome!**
2. **Initiation**
3. **Working with Creatives**
4. **Planning for impact**
5. **Reflection**
6. **Need inspiration?**

Initially, the _(2) Initiation_ section aims to provide tools that help collaboratively shape the actions by the Citizen Observatory, focusing on the active role of communities within the CO. This is done by providing a curated selection of different co-creation tools, as well as resources from various projects and practitioners experience. A special section, _(3)_ [_Working with Creatives_](https://action.toolkit.citiobs.eu/working-with-creatives), is dedicated to the connection with —and involvement of— creatives in the co-creation process and implementation of the actions. The _(4) Planning for Impact_ section is aimed at providing guidelines, based on previous experience and other tools, on how to plan, produce and deliver a community-led action.

_(5)_ [_Reflection_](https://action.toolkit.citiobs.eu/reflection) If you are planning a more complex citizen-led action, you want to continue it or seek more resources for the future, we recommend that you do an impact measurement that later supports the value of the action. If your action is smaller or one-off, it’s OK to skip this step.

Finally, the _(6)_ [_Need Inspiration_](https://action.toolkit.citiobs.eu/need-inspiration) provides a compilation of previous projects and examples that may inspire Citizen Observatories in their actions, linking with the previous sections when relevant.Think of this as a collection of helpful areas divided into 6 sections – _**Initiation, Implementation, Working with creatives, Reflection, and an Action Gallery**_, which you can explore in any order that suits your needs. You can use it by simply browsing through the different sections that interest you most, kind of like choosing what you need when you need it.



We’ve kept things simple and action-oriented. In this Toolkit, you will find:

* **A step-by-step process** for planning and launching a community-led creative project
* **Real examples** of how communities have worked with creatives to drive change
* **Tools & templates** to help you get started right away
* **Tips** on finding and collaborating with creatives—even if you've never worked with one before

By providing guidance on finding and involving creatives, particularly through connections like the Distributed Design Platform, this resource aims to nurture collaborations that enhance the impact and reach of your community-led actions. Those special tips for working with artists and other creative people will make your actions become more impactful.

#### Why a toolkit? <a href="#why-a-toolkit" id="why-a-toolkit"></a>

This toolkit aims **to empower you and your community to move beyond just awareness and planning towards concrete actions that lead to positive environmental change**. Keeping this in mind, this toolkit also provides resources which can help to foster relationships between Citizen Observatories and other communities in the local context, especially creatives, artists, local (maker)spaces and the cultural communities in the areas where the Citizen Observatories are based. This is brought about by providing tools and facilitating these connections through the Distributed Design Platform.

**What can you get out of this toolkit?**

You might be wondering, why this toolkit in the first place? Well, it was created for Citizen Observatories, groups of motivated individuals eager to protect their environment and enact positive change, who may lack the specific guidance and tools to translate their passion into effective action.

**By using this toolkit, you gain access to methods and resources that can drive energy and enthusiasm within your group, help you narrow down ideas and define the scope of your action, and map the resources you need and have available.** More importantly, it also provides guidance on how to collaborate with creatives, which can significantly amplify the reach and impact of your projects with innovative and engaging approaches.
