## How to Navigate this Toolkit

This toolkit has been designed to make it easy for the reader to move about freely, and jump to any particular section as needed.  However, we have attempted to organise it along a logical sequence (inspired by the [NESTA Open Book of Social Innovation](https://www.nesta.org.uk/report/the-open-book-of-social-innovation/)) that roughly represents the life-cycle of a project or an initiative:&#x20;

1. **REFLECTION** - this section
2. **DIALOGUE** - this section
3. **INSIGHT GATHERING** - this section
4. **PLANNING** - this section
5. **OUTREACH & ENGAGEMENT** - this section
6. **CO-CREATION & CO-PRODUCTION** - this section
7. **EVALUATION** - this section

Within each section, the title page&#x20;

* introduces the topic,&#x20;
* explains why it is relevant,&#x20;
* provides links to relevant resources, and&#x20;
* offers a list of further references.&#x20;

Over time we will continue to add resources and case study examples, and welcome any contributions that you might have, or suggestions of what might be missing. Just [drop us a note in this form](https://citiobs.eu/contact/), and we'd be be thrilled to add your suggestions to the toolkit!
