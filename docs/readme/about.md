# About

This toolkit is one of several being produced in the EU-funded **CitiObs** project ('_Enhancing Citizen Observatories for healthy, sustainable, resilient and inclusive cities'_) that aims to foster inclusive, diverse, and stable citizen participation in the observation, monitoring, and protection of urban environments.&#x20;

The aim of these tools is to:

* Enhance existing and new Citizen Observatories to engage people from a diverse range of communities
* Add value to environmental observations in the urban context
* Increase and validate citizen observations of the urban environment as part of the existing in-situ Earth Observation systems,
* Provide materials and guidance for co-creating inclusive local actions for sustainability
* Provide guidance and  tools to help aggregate standardize and validate data of the Citizen Observatories such that it can be easily accessed, referenced and reliably used for decision-making and policy development towards the objectives of the European Green Deal

**The Leave No One Behind (LNOB) Toolkit** is designed to help COs think through diversity and inclusion in a way that’s relevant to their specific locations and the issues they are working on. This toolkit pulls together practical guidance and resources from across Europe’s citizen science community to help COs make their initiatives more inclusive and representative of all stakeholders.​
