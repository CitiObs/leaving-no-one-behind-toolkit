# More about CitiObs

This toolkit is one of several being produced in the EU-funded **CitiObs** project ('_Enhancing Citizen Observatories for healthy, sustainable, resilient and inclusive cities'_) that aims to foster inclusive, diverse, and stable citizen participation in the observation, monitoring, and protection of urban environments.&#x20;

The aim of these tools is to:

* Enhance existing and new Citizen Observatories to engage people from a diverse range of communities
* Add value to environmental observations in the urban context
* Increase and validate citizen observations of the urban environment as part of the existing in-situ Earth Observation systems,
* Provide materials and guidance for co-creating inclusive local actions for sustainability
* Provide guidance and  tools to help aggregate standardize and validate data of the Citizen Observatories such that it can be easily accessed, referenced and reliably used for decision-making and policy development towards the objectives of the European Green Deal

Explore guidance on reaching and including diverse communities with the **Leave-No-One-Behind Toolkit**, strengthen stakeholder collaboration and resolve conflicts through the **Citizen Observatory Participation Dynamics Toolkit**, and access tools for organizing impactful community-led environmental actions with the **Citizen-Led Action Toolkit**. For those interested in environmental monitoring, the **Environmental Monitoring Toolkit** offers practical advice for utilizing environmental sensing devices effectively, ensuring data quality, interoperability, and accessibility. ​
