# About

This toolkit is part of the **CitiObs** project.

CitiObs (_Enhancing Citizen Observatories for healthy, sustainable, resilient and inclusive cities_) is a EU Project aimed at fostering inclusive, diverse, and stable citizen participation in the observation, monitoring, and protection of urban environments. **The Leave No One Behind (LNOB) Toolkit** is designed to help COs think through diversity and inclusion in a way that’s relevant to their specific locations and the issues they are working on. This toolkit pulls together practical guidance and resources from across Europe’s citizen science community to help COs make their initiatives more inclusive and representative of all stakeholders.​
