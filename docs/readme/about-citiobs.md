# About CitiObs

This toolkit is one of several being produced in the EU-funded **CitiObs** project ('_Enhancing Citizen Observatories for healthy, sustainable, resilient and inclusive cities'_) that aim to foster inclusive, diverse, and stable citizen participation in the observation, monitoring, and protection of urban environments.&#x20;

Alongside the **Leave-No-One-Behind Toolkit**, you can also find guidance for strengthening stakeholder collaboration and resolving conflicts in the **Citizen Observatory Participation Dynamics Toolkit**, access tools for organizing impactful community-led environmental actions with the **Citizen-Led Action Toolkit**, and find out more about tools and approaches for environmental monitoring in the **Environmental Monitoring Toolkit** , inlcuding practical advice for utilizing environmental sensing devices effectively, ensuring data quality, interoperability, and accessibility. ​

The aim of all of these tools is to:

* Enhance existing and new Citizen Observatories to engage people from a diverse range of communities
* Add value to environmental observations in the urban context
* Increase and validate citizen observations of the urban environment as part of the existing in-situ Earth Observation systems,
* Provide materials and guidance for co-creating inclusive local actions for sustainability
* Provide guidance and  tools to help aggregate standardize and validate data of the Citizen Observatories such that it can be easily accessed, referenced and reliably used for decision-making and policy development towards the objectives of the European Green Deal
