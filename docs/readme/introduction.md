# Introduction

## About this Toolkit

This toolkit aims **to enable you and your community to reflect on diversity and inclusion in your own context, and move beyond just awareness and dialogue towards concrete actions that lead to a more inclusive, diverse, and representative community of participants**. Keeping in mind that every Citizen Observatory is different, and the range of issues being investigated will affect different groups of people and stakeholders, we have endeavoured to collect a range of relevant resources developed by the European community of citizen science practitioners.&#x20;

**What can you get out of this toolkit?**

You might be wondering, why this toolkit in the first place? Well, it was created for Citizen Observatories, groups of motivated individuals eager to protect their environment and enact positive change, who may lack the specific guidance and tools to translate their passion into effective action.

**By using this toolkit, you gain access to methods and resources that can drive energy and enthusiasm within your group, help you narrow down ideas and define the scope of your action, and map the resources you need and have available.** More importantly, it also provides guidance on how to collaborate with creatives, which can significantly amplify the reach and impact of your projects with innovative and engaging approaches.
