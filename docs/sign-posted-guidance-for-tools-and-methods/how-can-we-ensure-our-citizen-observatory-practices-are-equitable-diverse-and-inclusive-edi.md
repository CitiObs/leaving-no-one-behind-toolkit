# How can we ensure our Citizen Observatory practices are equitable, diverse and inclusive (EDI)?

## Why is it relevant?

EDI is not simply a buzzword or a box to be checked; it is a fundamental value that should underpin all the activities of a CO. Understanding and embracing the principles of EDI will contribute to the success and impact of the CO. By investing time and effort into these areas, communities can foster a culture of fairness, respect, and collaboration that enables them to jointly tackle complex challenges with greater effectiveness and create a more just and inclusive society.

Striving for equity means recognizing and addressing the systemic biases and barriers that exist within our society. By understanding and acknowledging these disparities, we can actively work towards creating a level playing field, where everyone has an equal opportunity to participate, contribute, and benefit from the initiatives of the CO. This involves promoting inclusivity and ensuring that marginalised voices are heard and valued.

Furthermore, embracing diversity enriches our collective experience and fosters innovation and creativity. By actively seeking out and welcoming individuals from diverse backgrounds, perspectives, and experiences we can tap into a wealth of knowledge and insights that would otherwise remain untapped. This leads to more robust decision-making, increased adaptability, and a greater capacity for problem-solving.

On a final note, it is important to keep in mind that the roots of inequity and injustice are systemic and cannot be solved with a single action. Nevertheless, being aware of the different issues and striving for equity and inclusion are some of the necessary steps to create a cultural change.

## How can it be done?

Perform an EDI ‘health check’ within the CO

✓ One of the first steps is to examine how your CO is currently dealing with inclusivity. There are checklists that can support the team in reflecting how equitable and inclusive the current processes are. Other tools can help the team discuss key questions about user involvement and how they relate with priorities from the community.

✓ Discuss key questions with your team/CO to find out about your inclusive user involvement.

✓ Design the programme in line with community priorities.

Review communications and activities for inclusive language and the removal of barriers

The language, design, and format used in your CO communication plays a significant role in accessibility. Using inclusive communication will increase awareness of barriers to inclusivity in general, which in turn will ensure your activities and development work are also inclusive.

Inclusive language goes beyond the use of different languages (such as Greek, Catalan, Spanish, English, Dutch and Swedish in the case of the CitiObs Frontrunners) and focuses also on registers and the vocabulary used. This is not only to appeal to different groups but to ensure no offensive or discriminatory language is used. Next to the contents of the text, the way in which it is presented can have a huge impact on inclusivity. The fonts and colours used should be accessible for different groups. For example, the colours should be chosen so that the design is accessible to colour-blind people; or having large fonts to facilitate reading for those who cannot read small letters. All communications must be fit for purpose, which entails considering the COs audience and the groups the team wants to reach out to.

COs can train their teams on inclusive communication and to be aware of the language used as well as accessibility considerations such as fonts and colours. This awareness on inclusiveness extends to how activities are organised and the work of the CO in general. Given that language plays such a big role in shaping our views and the world around us, focusing on it will aid the CO's team to become more aware of how inclusive the activities are.

✓ _Make your communication and activities inclusive_

* Train your team about inclusive (science) communication.
* Create consent forms that are easy and accessible.
* Check that your use of language is inclusive.
* Take into consideration accessibility issues (fonts, colours).
* Be mindful of the different backgrounds of participants when recruiting and onboarding.
* Organise activities (e.g. meetings, events, workshops, training) as inclusive as possible considering the physical space, the background knowledge that is assumed people have, and the language that is used.

**CHECKLIST:** The **SOCIO-BEE Inclusion and Non-discrimination Checklist** is designed to help Citizen Science projects reflect on inclusion processes and equality at all stages. The aim of this questionnaire is not only to encourage reflection and debate on the need to take into account the criteria of inclusion and equality in citizen science but also to help projects and the people involved in them to improve their dynamics of participation and management of the knowledge generated. _\[Clarification on the missing link – the checklist is currently under its final review and will be published later this year in the SOCIO-BEE website. We will add the proper link in the online version of this toolkit]._

**GUIDE:** The **BTUS Practical Guide: Towards inclusive user involvement** is a report which purpose is to offer practical help to develop more inclusive involvement for the future so that everyone who wants to be involved has equal opportunities to do so. [https://shapingourlives.org.uk/report/beyond-the-usual-suspects-guide](https://shapingourlives.org.uk/report/beyond-the-usual-suspects-guide). This guide also includes several interesting electronic guides and other resources:

**WORKSHOP:** The **GlobeScape “Justice, Equity, Diversity and Inclusion (JEDI) in Science Communication” workshop** is intended to be an opportunity for science communicators from different regions of the world to see how issues of justice, equity, diversity and inclusion can factor into their practices. However, it can easily be adapted to other practices such as Citizen Observatories. [https://zenodo.org/record/7764990#.ZCG0UHZBxD9.](https://zenodo.org/record/7764990#.ZCG0UHZBxD9.)

**TOOL:** The **SensJus Visual Consent Form** is a tool where you can access and edit template forms that combine visuals and text for consent forms and for informing participants of the project. The aim is to address participants who may have a low literacy level, for whom the standard consent forms and information sheets might fail to achieve an aware participation and informed consent. The forms also illustrate to prospect participants their rights as (research) data subjects according to the GDPR. These forms, co-developed by the SensJus project with a visual artist, are available as non-commercial creative commons resources.

**GUIDE:** The **Making a Change: A guide to running successful and accessible workshops and training** is a guide based on the evaluation of a programme of workshops that were part of the Standards We Expect Project in 2007. The workshops were aimed at a wide range of service users taking part in the Project. The organisers wanted everyone to be able to take part equally but found it difficult to set up training and workshops. They also found that there was no pre-existing guidance on what to do when setting up training or workshops. This guide was put together to answer that absence. The guide includes all the stages of setting up a training programme: it starts with deciding on what training is needed and goes all the way through to evaluation. It gives general advice and examples of what was done in the Standards We Expect training programme and outlines how to ensure everyone is included in the training and everyone has an equal say.

**FURTHER READING**: The **CitiMeasure's Guidelines on Competencies for Digital Inclusion** aim to advance the understanding of the issue of ‘competencies‘ for inclusion in increasingly digitised Citizen Science initiatives. They are primarily developed to guide those who are interested in identifying, understanding, and enhancing capacities and competencies required for digital inclusion of different actors in Citizen Science projects. This includes cities, organisations, researchers, and practitioners who are involved in initiating a Citizen Science project or those who aim to study or improve current actor inclusion practices in existing Citizen Science initiatives.
