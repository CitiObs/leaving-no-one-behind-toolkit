# Welcome

Welcome to the CitiObs Leave-No-One-Behind (LNOB) Toolkit, which is designed to help Citizen Observatories think through diversity and inclusion in a way that’s relevant to their specific locations and the issues they are working on. This toolkit contains practical guidance and resources from across Europe’s citizen science community to help Citizen Observatories make their initiatives more inclusive and representative of all stakeholders.​

The aim of the **LNOB Toolkit** is to help you to:

**Engage a broader range of participants:** Reach out to diverse communities and individuals who may have been underserved.

**Connect with specific groups:** Engage with key groups that may be difficult to reach.

**Create an inclusive environment:** Involve people with a stake in the issue or those disproportionately impacted by it.

**Assess who may be left behind:** Reflect on who isn’t yet involved and explore ways to include them.

**Ensure ethical engagement:** Design outreach that respects and supports diverse communities.

**Consider justice and equity:** Bring a focus on justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion into your Citizen Observatory’s work.
