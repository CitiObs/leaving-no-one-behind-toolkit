# Welcome

Welcome to the CitiObs Leave-No-One-Behind (LNOB) Toolkit, which is designed to help Citizen Observatories think through diversity and inclusion in a way that’s relevant to their specific locations and the issues they are working on. This toolkit contains practical guidance and resources from across Europe’s citizen science community to help Citizen Observatories make their initiatives more inclusive and representative of all stakeholders.​

The aim of the **LNOB Toolkit** is to help you to:

* **Consider issues of inclusion, diversity, equity, and justice** in the context of your Citizen Observatory and its activities,
* **Reflect on who may be left behind** in your context, and explore ways to include them in your activities,
* **Identify ways you might reach and engage** a broader range of participants and communities, and groups who may be under-represented,
* **Create an inclusive environment** to involve people with a stake in the issue or those disproportionately impacted by it.
* **Consider ethical issues** when you are planning  your outreach and engagement activities, such that they are respectul and supportive of diverse communities.
