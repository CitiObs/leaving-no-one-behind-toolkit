# Welcome

Welcome to the CitiObs Leave-No-One-Behind (LNOB) Toolkit. This toolkit contains practical guidance and resources from across Europe’s citizen science community to help Citizen Observatories (CO) and Citizen Science (CS) initiatives consider ways that they can reach and engage with a more diverse, inclusive, and representative group of participants and stakeholders.

The aim of the **LNOB Toolkit** is to help you to:

* **Consider issues of inclusion, diversity, equity, and justice** in the context of your initiative and its activities,
* **Reflect on what communities and groups of people may be left behind** in your context, and explore ways to include them in your activities,
* **Identify ways you might reach and engage** a broader range of participants and communities, and groups who may be under-represented,
* **Create an inclusive environment** to involve people with a stake in the issue you're investigating, or those disproportionately impacted by it.
* **Consider ethical issues** when you are planning  your outreach and engagement activities, such that they are respectful and supportive of diverse communities.
