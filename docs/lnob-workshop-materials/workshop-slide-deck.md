# Workshop Slide Deck

The current version of the workshop contains 84 slides to help people understand and engage with the concepts of Justice, Equity, Diversity, Inclusion, and ‘Leaving No One Behind’. These are not yet shared online to maintain version control, but are being shared with the Frontrunner Cases during the testing phase. The final version of these slides will be uploaded to Zenodo and contained in the LNOB Toolkit and CitiObs Cookbook.
