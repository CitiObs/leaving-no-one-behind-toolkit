# Suggested Workshop Structure

## Practicalities

The suggested time allotment for the workshop is 3 hours, to allow for reflection and discussion, and to leave time for interactive activities and a break in between. Theobjective of the workshop is to introduce key concepts around Justice, Equity, Diversity and Inclusion (JEDI) and the pledge to ‘Leave No One Behind’; to develop a shared vocabulary and understanding as a group; and to provide a foundation for further consideration of these concepts in the context of the Citizen Observatory or Citizen Science initiative. We recommend running the workshop in person, when possible, to aid connection and discussion, but recognise that this is not always possible, and therefore the materials are in a format that can also be used online. We additionally recommend that some light reading is provided to participants before the workshop, to already begin to familiarise themselves with the LNOB pledge and concepts, such as those contained in Section 1 of the Toolkit as an introduction to LNOB.

## Materials

* Presentation Slide Deck
* Facilitators Guide
* Workbook
* Potential background reading for workshop participants

## Workshop objectives

* To explain what is meant by the terms: justice, equity, diversity and inclusion (JEDI).
* To explain the ‘Leave No One Behind’ (LNOB) concept and pledge.
* To recognise the importance of prioritising JEDI in Citizen Science and participatory research practices.
* To explain of how diverse and equitable practices can increase inclusion in the activities of Citizen Observatories.
* To describe how the activities of Citizen Observatories can be used to address issues of social justice.
* To facilitate a reflection of their relevance to the specific case and context of the FRC and together discuss how these missing or under-represented groups of people might be engaged.
* As a result of these conversations, specific guidance and other resources within the LNOB Toolkit will be pointed to, or a plan made to address that gap in the Toolkit.
