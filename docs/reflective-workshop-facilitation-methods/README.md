# REFLECTIVE WORKSHOP FACILITATION METHODS

We have selected a short-list of effective workshop facilitation methods to aid reflection and discussions of the relevance of the JEDI and LNOB concepts to the context of one's Citizen Observatory, based on our own experience of using them and the feedback of the European Citizen Science practitioner community gathered during the ECSA2024 Conference joint-workshop on Diversity & Inclusion in April 2024, and the online workshop with the ECSA EIE Working Group. The selection was made based on their suitability for facilitating a reflection of oneâ€™s own context and citizen science initiative, who is included or excluded, and what groups or communities risk being left behind.

In the section below we briefly introduce and describe the selected methods, along with images of the Method Cards that were utilised during the method feedback selection workshops. Descriptive documentation will be developed during the upcoming testing phase with the Frontrunner and Alliance Cases. The final LNOB Toolkit will contain this more detailed documentation, along with guidance for the application of these methods with different stakeholder groups, at different stages of the CO lifecycle.
