# The Equity Compass

The Equity Compass is a reflection tool produced by the [YESTEM project](https://yestem.org/) in the context of engaging young people with science, with the aim of supporting socially just practice. The tool helps partners to reflect on how they work with underserved young people and to think about how they might introduce more participatory approaches, improve professional development and better articulate where they want to be going.&#x20;

The Compass is made up of eight different dimensions describing a different aspect of equity, which are designed to help you think and discuss equity from a different perspective.
