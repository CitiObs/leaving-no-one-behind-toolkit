# How can we engage with the concepts of Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI)?

## Why is it relevant?

As citizen observatories continue to make important contributions to environmental monitoring and governance, it is crucial to embed equity, diversity, and inclusion into their fabric, such that the collaborative and participatory practices of COs can achieve long-lasting and sustainable outcomes that benefit all of society.

By actively engaging with equity, diversity, and inclusion, citizen observatories can reap numerous benefits. Firstly, they can enhance the quality and reliability of data by capturing a broader range of perspectives and knowledge systems. This inclusive approach can uncover unique insights, improve the accuracy of findings, and inform more robust decision-making. Additionally, citizen observatories can foster social cohesion by facilitating interactions between diverse groups, promoting dialogue, and fostering mutual understanding. For example, inviting local residents from diverse backgrounds to co-facilitate the trainings and workshops were found by Rickenbacker et al. (2019) to be crucial in promoting environmental justice among peers and empower participants. In addition, according to Turbridy et al. (2022), there are important issues surrounding the measurement and production of knowledge about air pollution that directly connects with inequality and power.
