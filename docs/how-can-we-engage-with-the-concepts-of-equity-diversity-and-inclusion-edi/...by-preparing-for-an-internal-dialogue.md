# ...by preparing for an internal dialogue?

A good way to start to prepare the members of your CO or core team of partners is to discusse setting aside dedicated time to explore these themes in more detail, in an open dialoge with each other.&#x20;

✓ Organise a CO and team meeting to have structured conversations on Equity, Diversity and Inclusion through workshops.

✓ Select an online MOOC or video workshop to watch together as a team, such as the **GlobeScape “Justice, Equity, Diversity and Inclusion (JEDI) in Science Communication” workshop** listed in the resources below.&#x20;

✓ Place equity and inclusion at the heart of your communication and engagement strategy and setting clear strategic priorities for overcoming structural inequalities when planning activities.

✓ Use the concept of centering racial equity to advance the CO strategy, build understanding, strengthen relationships, and support in reaching collective goals.
