# ...by learning more from local groups in the community?

One way to learn more about the equity, diversity and inclusion in your own local context is to seek out community groups or societal initiatives that are active on these themes, who you can reach out for insights and collaboration.

✓ Seek local groups or Communities of Practice (CoP) in your city, location, or country to join where you can share ideas and learn about these topics.

✓ Seek international/global CoPs that you might want to join, such as the [ECSA EIE Working Group](https://www.ecsa.ngo/working-groups/empowerment-inclusiveness-equity/), the [Diversci CoP](https://www.diversci.eu/our-community/), the [Partos Platform Leave No One Behind](https://leidenuniv1.sharepoint.com/sites/CitizenScienceLab-CitiObs/Shared%20Documents/CitiObs/Deliverables/Leave%20No%20One%20Behind%20Platform), or the [Partos CoP on Inclusive Communication](https://www.partos.nl/werkgroep/community-of-practice-inclusive-communications/).



## Useful resources

**COMMUNITY:** The **Diversci Community of Practice** (CoP) provides opportunities for peers to share both good practice and failed attempts through a participative dynamic, in which everyone is welcome. The CoP meets regularly in an informal and open setting, discussing and sharing ideas, point of views and testimonies that allow each of the participants to find their own approach to an equitable, diverse and inclusive organisation.

**TOOLKIT**: The **Racial Equity Toolkit** is designed to support backbone staff and partners to operationalize racial equity throughout their collective impact work. Through a mix of personal reflection exercises, conversations, and activities, this toolkit will help teams explore how centering racial equity can advance their strategies, build understanding, strengthen relationships, and support in reaching their collective goals. Please note that the website requires sign-up. [https://collectiveimpactforum.org/resource/racial-equity-toolkit](https://collectiveimpactforum.org/resource/racial-equity-toolkit).

**TOOLKIT**: Bond's **Anti-racism and decolonising. A framework for organisations**. This framework maps out how racism cuts across all areas of our organisations and shows the necessity of an anti-racist and holistic approach to decolonising our organisations to create a fairer, more equitable and racially just sector.

**TOOL:** The **DiverSci First Aid Kit**. This short guide offers a quick fix for situations that have been encountered frequently: Do you need help right now? Where to start? How to convince your team on diversity and inclusivity? [https://www.diversci.eu/first-aid-kit/](https://www.diversci.eu/first-aid-kit/)

**WORKSHOP**: The **DiverSci Spark Self Evaluation Workshop** is a tool for collective reflection and internal evaluation. It helps organisations to have structured, yet difficult conversations on Equity, Diversity and Inclusion and to measure their institutional knowledge and practices regarding social justice. Spark is not just a self-evaluation tool: it is a means to committing to and implementing change. [https://www.diversci.eu/evaluation-workshop](https://www.diversci.eu/evaluation-workshop).

**WORKSHOP:** The **GlobeScape “Justice, Equity, Diversity and Inclusion (JEDI) in Science Communication” workshop** is intended to be an opportunity for science communicators from different regions of the world to see how issues of justice, equity, diversity and inclusion can factor into their practices. This resource has formed the basis of our own LNOB Workshop slide-deck, adjusted to the context of Citizen Observatories and their activities rather than that of Science Communicators (as described in Section 1.1.). The original source material contains workshop templates to augment the workshop slides, and a complete filmed version of the workshop that can thus be followed online in one's own time.
