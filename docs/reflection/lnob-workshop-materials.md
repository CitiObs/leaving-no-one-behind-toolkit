# LNOB Workshop Materials

The CitiObs LNOB Workshop materials introducing the concepts of Justice, Equity, Diversity and Inclusion (JEDI) and the pledge to "Leave No One Behind' take the form of a slide presentation, along with interactivity materials, and guidance for the use of both with key stakeholders at different stages of the CO lifecycle.

### 1.1 Workshop Slide Deck

The current version of the workshop contains 84 slides to help people understand and engage with the concepts of Justice, Equity, Diversity, Inclusion, and ‘Leaving No One Behind’. These are not yet shared online to maintain version control, but are being shared with the Frontrunner Cases during the testing phase. The final version of these slides will be uploaded to Zenodo and contained in the LNOB Toolkit and CitiObs Cookbook.

### 1.2 Suggested Workshop Structure

Practicalities:

The suggested time allotment for the workshop is 3 hours, to allow for reflection and discussion, and to leave time for interactive activities and a break in between. The objective of the workshop is to introduce key concepts around Justice, Equity, Diversity and Inclusion (JEDI) and the pledge to ‘Leave No One Behind’; to develop a shared vocabulary and understanding as a group; and to provide a foundation for further consideration of these concepts in the context of the Citizen Observatory or Citizen Science initiative. We recommend running the workshop in person, when possible, to aid connection and discussion, but recognise that this is not always possible, and therefore the materials are in a format that can also be used online. We additionally recommend that some light reading is provided to participants before the workshop, to already begin to familiarise themselves with the LNOB pledge and concepts, such as those contained in Section 1 of the Toolkit as an introduction to LNOB.

&#x20;

Materials:

·       Presentation Slide Deck

·       Facilitators Guide

·       Workbook

·       Potential background reading for workshop participants

&#x20;

Workshop objectives:

·       To explain what is meant by the terms: justice, equity, diversity and inclusion (JEDI).

·       To explain the ‘Leave No One Behind’ (LNOB) concept and pledge.

·       To recognise the importance of prioritising JEDI in Citizen Science and participatory research practices.

·       To explain of how diverse and equitable practices can increase inclusion in the activities of Citizen Observatories.

·       To describe how the activities of Citizen Observatories can be used to address issues of social justice.

·       To facilitate a reflection of their relevance to the specific case and context of the FRC and together discuss how these missing or under-represented groups of people might be engaged.

·       As a result of these conversations, specific guidance and other resources within the LNOB Toolkit will be pointed to, or a plan made to address that gap in the Toolkit.&#x20;

### 1.3 Workshop Guidance

As the CitiObs project enters the phase of testing and further developing the Beta version of the LNOB Toolkit via mentoring sessions with the CitiObs Frontrunner Cases, and trialling these workshop materials in practice, we will develop guidance for future users of the Toolkit to run these workshops themselves. This guidance material is therefore not yet developed.
